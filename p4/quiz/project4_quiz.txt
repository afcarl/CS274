Part 1. Chemical Similarity

1. The tanimoto coefficient measures the similarity between two drugs, based on each drugs 2D fingerprint.


2. Yes, they are different. The histogram for drugs that share a target is shifted to the right relative to the histogram for drugs that do NOT share a target. This means that the mean Tanimoto score is higher for drugs that share a target, implying that drugs which share a target tend to be more similar to each other (in terms of their 2D fingerprints) than drugs which do not share a target. This makes sense.


3. A more accurate way to compare two molecules would be to take into account the 3D strucutre, i.e. the positions of atoms within the molecule, as opposed to just their 2D representation.


Part 2. Ligand Set Similarity

4a. 
Total score: 29.2
E-value: 2.2

4b. 
Total score: 47.0
E-value: 0.27

4c. 
Total score: 61.2
E-value: 2.0

5. Although the vast mahority of sequences listed as 'significant alignments' are indeed forms of DHFR, some of those sequences are not. These results tell us that there are human proteins that bind some of the same ligands as DHFR, since we know that form implies functionality, and, therefore, proteins with similar sequences will likely bind ot the same ligands.


6. If we consider the total score, the proteins in Question 4 are not that similar, since their total score values are on the order of ~30-60, whereas the 'significant' alignments we see in Question 5 have total score values of around 380, about a factor of 10 higher.


7a. 
P-value: 0.23

7b. 
P-value: 0.0

7c. 
P-value: 0.02

8. 
Most similar: DHFR and TYMS
Somewhat similar: F2 and TYMS
Not similar: DHFR and F2

A low p-value implies that two proteins are similar. This means that many of the same drugs bind these proteins.

Part 3. Network Visualization

9. 
Highly connected means ... there were a lot of other proteins (nodes) with whom this protein had a significantly low p-value. 
Biochemically, it means that ... this protein shares with a lot of other proteins the drugs that bind it, i.e. the drugs that bind it also bind lots of other proteins

10. Yes, we see a nice clustering of nodes by color in the network, implying that proteins tend to form interconnections based on their annotated indications. A node might be connected with nodes of different colors, because some of the indications may stem from the same biochemical processes, e.g. metabolic pathways, in which case clearly the same set of drugs that bind one protein will bind the other, thus resulting in an edge between the nodes.
